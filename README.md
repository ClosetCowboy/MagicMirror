# MagicMirror
Seeing a twitter post of someone making a digital mirror, I decided to make one. This is how I made it. I had no prior experinece with working on computers, so if it looks ugly thats why, but it still works well enough for me. 

This is my version of the popular https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror. 

It was done by obtaining a larger monitor and a Rasberry PI. I reccomend getting a keyboard with a bluetooth connection via USB to navigate on the Rasberry PI.
